## web scraping_ h1b jobs for international students

This web scraping project was built from [h1b salary database](https://h1bdata.info/index.php), which helps international students who aim to become a data scientist to narrow down the companies. 

H-1B visas are a category of employment-based, non-immigrant visas for temporary foreign workers in the United States.It is also the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position.

Searching for companies who sponsor h1b visa is really time-consuming for international students, and the situation may varies from year to year. Therefore, I created a project that help students save more time if they needs to find a job in 2019.
